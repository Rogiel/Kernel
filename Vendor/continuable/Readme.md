> Async C++14 platform independent continuation chainer providing light and allocation aware futures

This library provides full feature support of:

* async continuation chaining using **callbacks** (*then*).
* **no enforced type-erasure** which means we need **extremely fewer heap allocations** .
* support for **finite logical connections** between continuables through an **all, any or sequence** strategy.
* **syntactic sugar** for attaching callbacks to a continuation like partial invocation or tuple unpacking.


> **Note:** This library only provides the facility for building asynchronous functions. Thus functions shown in the examples and the documentation like `http_request`, `mysql_query` or `read_file` aren't provided by this library.

## The library design

The continuable library was designed in order to provide you as much as flexibility as possible:

- There is no enforced type erasure which means there is less memory allocation and thus the callback chains are heavily optimizable by the compiler. That's why the library is well usable in the embedded or gaming field. **Don't pay for what you don't use!**
- The library provides support for **dispatching callbacks on a given executor**, however, it doesn't provide it's own one. You probably will use your own executor like [asio](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio), [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) or a corresponding [lock-free concurrentqueue](https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue) anyway. In most cases, the executor will do the type erasure for you, so there is no reason to do it twice.
- The library provides as much as **syntactic sugar** as it's possible, in order to make continuation chaining expressive and simple. For instance, it allows you to logical connect continuables through the well-known operators `&&` and `||`.
- The library is header only and has **fewer dependencies**:
  - The `continuable-base.hpp` header only depends on the standard library and provides the basic continuation logic.
  - The `continuable-test.hpp` header also depends on `gtest` because it adds various test macros for asserting on the result of asynchronous continuations.
  - The `continuable.hpp`header depends on my header-only [function2](https://github.com/Naios/function2) library for providing efficient type erasure - non-copyable objects are natively supported without any workaround.


## Installation

### How-to use

As mentioned earlier the library is header-only. There is a cmake project provided for simple setup:

```sh
# Shell:
git submodule add https://github.com/Naios/continuable.git
```

```cma
# CMake file:
add_subdirectory(continuable)
# continuable provides an interface target which makes it's
# headers available to all projects using the continuable library.
target_link_libraries(my_project continuable)
```

On POSIX platforms you are required to link your application against a corresponding thread library, otherwise `std::future's` won't work properly, this is done automatically by the provided cmake project.

### Building the unit-tests

In order to build the unit tests clone the repository recursively with all submodules:

```sh
# Shell:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Naios/continuable.git
```
## Stability and version

The library follows the rules of [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), the API is kept stable across minor versions.

The CI driven unit-tests are observed through the Clang sanitizers (asan, ubsan and lsan - when compiling with Clang) or Valgrind (when compiling with GCC).

## Quick reference

This chapter only overflies the functionality of the continuable library, the full documentation is located at https://naios.github.io/continuable/.

### Creating Continuables 

Create a continuable from a callback taking function:

```c++
#include "continuable/continuable-base.hpp"
// ...

auto void_continuable = cti::make_continuable<void>([](auto&& callback) {
  //                                          ^^^^
  
  // Call the callback later when you have finished your work
  callback();
});

auto str_continuable = cti::make_continuable<std::string>([](auto&& callback) {
  //                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^
  callback("Hello, World!");
});
```

### Chaining Continuables

Chain continuables together in order to build up an asynchronous call hierarchy:

```c++
mysql_query("SELECT `id`, `name` FROM `users`")
  .then([](ResultSet users) {
    // Return the next continuable to process ...
    return mysql_query("SELECT `id` name FROM `sessions`");   
  })
  .then([](ResultSet sessions) {
    // ... or pass multiple values to the next callback using tuples or pairs ...
    return std::make_tuple(std::move(sessions), true);
  })
  .then([](ResultSet sessions, bool is_ok) {
    // ... or pass a single value to the next callback ...
    return 10;
  })
  .then([](auto value) {
    //     ^^^^ Templated callbacks are possible too
  })
  // ... you may even pass continuables to the `then` method directly:
  .then(mysql_query("SELECT * `statistics`"))
  .then([](ResultSet result) {
    // ...
  });
```

> **Note:** The continuation chain is invoked when the object is destructed or the `done()` method is called.

### Providing helper functions

Returning continuables from helper functions makes chaining simple and expressive:

```c++
#include "continuable/continuable-base.hpp"
// ...

auto mysql_query(std::string query) {
  return cti::make_continuable<ResultSet>([query = std::move(query)](auto&& callback) mutable {
    // Pass the callback to the handler which calls the callback when finished.
    // Every function accepting callbacks works with continuables.
    mysql_handle_async_query(std::move(query),
                             std::forward<decltype(callback)>(callback));
  });
}

// You may use the helper function like you would normally do,
// without using the support methods of the continuable.
mysql_query("DELETE FROM `users` WHERE `id` = 27361");

// Or using chaining to handle the result which is covered in the documentation.
mysql_query("SELECT `id`, `name` FROM users")
  .then([](ResultSet result) {
    // ...
  });
```


### Connecting Continuables {all, any or sequential}

Continuables provide the operators **&&** and **||** for logical connection:

* **&&** invokes the final callback with the compound result of all connected continuables, the continuables were invoked in parallel.
* **||** invokes the final callback once with the first result which becomes available.
* **>\>** invokes the final callback with the compound result of all connected continuables but the continuations were invokes sequentially.

```C++
auto http_request(std::string url) {
  return cti::make_continuable<std::string>([](auto&& callback) {
    callback("<html>...</html>");
  });
}

// `all` of connections:
(http_request("github.com") && http_request("travis-ci.org") && http_request("atom.io"))
  .then([](std::string github, std::string travis, std::string atom) {
    // The callback is called with the response of github, travis and atom.
  });

// `any` of connections:
(http_request("github.com") || http_request("travis-ci.org") || http_request("atom.io"))
  .then([](std::string github_or_travis_or_atom) {
    // The callback is called with the first response of either github, travis or atom.
  });

// `sequence` of connections:
(http_request("github.com") >> http_request("travis-ci.org") >> http_request("atom.io"))
  .then([](std::string github, std::string travis, std::string atom) {
    // The requests are invoked sequentially
  });

// mixed logical connections:
(http_request("github.com") && (http_request("travis-ci.org") || http_request("atom.io")))
  .then([](std::string github, std::string travis_or_atom) {
    // The callback is called with the response of github for sure
    // and the second parameter represents the response of travis or atom.
  });

// There are helper functions for connecting continuables:
auto all = cti::all_of(http_request("github.com"), http_request("travis-ci.org"));
auto any = cti::any_of(http_request("github.com"), http_request("travis-ci.org"));
auto seq = cti::seq_of(http_request("github.com"), http_request("travis-ci.org"));
```

> **Note:** Logical connections are ensured to be **thread-safe** and **wait-free** by library design (when assuming that *std::call_once* is wait-free - which depends on the toolchain).

### Partial argument application

The callback is called only with the arguments it's accepting:

```c++
(http_request("github.com") && read_file("entries.csv"))
  .then([] {
    // ^^^^^^ The original signature was <std::string, Buffer>,
    // however, the callback is only invoked with the amount of
    // arguments it's accepting.
  });
```

### Dispatching callbacks through a specific executor

Dispatching a callback through a specific executor is supported through through the second argument of `then()`:

```c++
auto executor = [](auto&& work) {
  // Dispatch the work here, store it for later invocation or move it to another thread.
  std::forward<decltype(work)>(work)();
};

read_file("entries.csv")
  .then([](Buffer buffer) {
    // ...
  }, executor);
//   ^^^^^^^^
```

### Type erasure

The library was designed in order to avoid type-erasure until really needed. Thus we provide traits to create an alias to a continuable using the **type-erasure backend of your choice**. All templated functors providing a call operator may be used as a backend (*std::function* for instance).

The library provides aliases for using my [function2 library](https://github.com/Naios/function2) as backend which provides efficient and qualifier correct function wrappers for copyable and non-copyable objects.

```c++
#include "continuable/continuable.hpp"
// ...

cti::unique_continuable<int, std::string> unique =
      cti::make_continuable([value = std::make_unique<int>(0)](auto&& callback) {

  // The use of non copyable objects is possible by design if
  // the type erasure backend supports it.
  callback(*value, "Hello, World!");
});

std::move(unique).then([](int i) {
  // ...
});
```

However you may still define your own continuation wrapper with the backend of your choice, but keep in mind that the capabilities of your wrapper determine the possible objects, the continuation is capable of carrying. This limits continuations using *std::function* as a backend to copyable types:

```c++
template <typename... Args>
using my_continuation = typename cti::continuable_trait<
  std::function, std::function, Args...
>::continuable;

// ...

my_continuation<int> myc = cti::make_continuable([](auto&& callback) {
  //                                         ^^^^^
  // Signatures may be omitted for continuables which are type erased
  callback(0);
});
```

We could also think about using  `std::future` as backend but this is even worse then using `std::function` because usually there is, even more, type erasure and allocations involved.

### Future conversion

The library is capable of converting (*futurizing*) every continuable into a fitting **std::future** through the `continuable<...>::futurize()` method.:

```c++
std::future<std::string> future = http_request("github.com")
  .then([](std::string response) {
    // Do sth...
    return http_request("travis-ci.org") || http_request("atom.io");
  })
  .futurize();
// ^^^^^^^^

std::future<std::tuple<std::string, std::string>> future =
  (http_request("travis-ci.org") && http_request("atom.io")).futurize();
```

> **Note:** See the [doxygen documentation](https://naios.github.io/continuable/) for detailed information about the return type of `futurize()`.

## Compatibility

Tested & compatible with:

- Visual Studio 2015+ Update 3
- Clang 3.6+
- GCC 5.0+

Every compiler with modern C++14 support should work.

The library only depends on the standard library when using the `continuable/continuable-base.hpp` header, which provides the basic continuation logic.

> **Note:** On Posix: don't  forget to **link a corresponding thread library** into your application otherwise `std::future's` won't work `(-pthread)`.

## Similar implementations and alternatives

You already thought it, the idea isn't new and thus it is well known in the JavaScript world already.

There are some existing solutions with similar design thoughts already, which I don't want to hold back from you - you should choose the library fitting your needs best:

#### **[q (C++)](https://github.com/grantila/q)**

Is designed in a similar way, however, it orientates itself more on the corresponding JavaScript libraries which leaves some benefits behind we could reach with modern C++ meta-programming. Like previous approaches, the library uses type erasure excessively (and thus isn't memory allocation aware). What differentiates **q** from the continuable library is that it supports infinite logical connections and ships with built-in exception support as well as it's own executors (thread pools) - thus the library isn't header-only anymore (but the library is still proclaimed to work with other executors). My personal opinion is that a continuation library shouldn't include any other stuff then the continuation logic itself.

#### [cpprestsdk](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk)

Basically, the same arguments as explained in the q section apply to the cpprestsdk as well, it's major drawbacks is the overwhelming use of type-erasure. Probably you will benefit a lot from the library if you intend to use it's provided asynchronously *http*, *websocket* and *filesystem* functionalities. The *continuable* library was designed with different thoughts in mind - it basically provides the continuation logic without any support methods so you can embed it into your application without depending on a heavy framework. This makes it possible to apply continuation chaning to esoteric domains such as C++ AI scripts with fast or immediately response times. Who knows - maybe someone will provide *continuable* wrappers for open-source libraries like *asio*, libuv or *uWebSockets* in the future too.


> **Note:** If I forget to mention a library here let me know, so we can add the alternatives.
